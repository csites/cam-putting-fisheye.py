def estimate_stimp(V_initial, V_final, Distance):
  """
  Estimates the stimp of a putting green based on the initial and final speed of a golf ball.

  Args:
    V_initial = initial_speed: The initial speed of the golf ball in feet per second.
    V_final = final_speed: The final speed of the golf ball in feet per second.
    Distance: The distance that the golf ball rolled in meters.

  Returns:
    The estimated stimp of the putting green.

  Discussion: 
    We have a golfball rolling acorss a mat.  The mat is soft and the ball sinks a small 
    amount into the mat elastically.  We need to compute the coefficient_of_rolling_first, and since the stimp 
    is proportional to the coefficient_of_rolling_friction, we multiply by a constant to get stimp.  As 
    complicated as the model is, the we can get a good estimate based on the simple formula,
    that COF = (V_initial^2 - V_final^2) / (2 * g * Distance * mass).
    And stimp = COF * conversion_constant.
